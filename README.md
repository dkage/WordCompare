# Word compare

This is a simple project made for getting every word that is written the same way in both brazilian portuguese and 
english languages.

The texts files with the lists of words used in this, were grabbed from these repos:

[English Words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
[Brazilian Portuguese words](https://github.com/pythonprobr/palavras)
